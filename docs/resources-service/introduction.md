# Introduction

The resource service allow you to manage the in-game resources of your players and to convert them into FTs.

## Concepts

### Resource

A resource defines a type of in-game non unique assets.

Examples of resources: gold, coins, gems, wood, mud, ...

### Token

A given resource can be linked with an on-chain Fungible Token. This will allow players to convert the in-game 
resources into tokens, and to get back resources by spending the tokens.

Examples of fungible tokens: [BRWL](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/blockchain-brawlers/)

### Player's resources

For each game, a player has a resource balance with the amount of resources he owns. You can interact with this 
balance to give or withdraw resources.
